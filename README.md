<h1>Font Programming Icons/Glyphs</h1>
The goal of this package is to provide a set of web fonts for direct use via CSS for programming/technology-facing sites, where the user needs to display trademarks, software and operating systems matter co-related through its pages.

Note: All brand icons are trademarks of their respective owners. The use of these trademarks does not indicate endorsement of the trademark holder by Drifty, nor vice versa.

Check the demo.html file include in this project to see which brands (languages, operational systems logo, frameworks are part of the content).

We’ve also included each icon’s class name for easy copy/pasting when you’re developing!


<h1>Install</h1>
Download and extract the font pack
Copy the style.css to your project
Copy the /fonts content folder to your project
Ensure the font urls within style.css properly reference the fonts path within your project.
Include a reference to the /fpg/style.css file from every webpage you need to use it.

<u>Recommendation:</u> create a sub-folder in your project called fpg to split it from the rest of your project

<h1>HTML Example</h1>

You can use the sample under /demo to easily find the icon you want to use. Once you've copied the desired icon's CSS classname, simply add the icon and icon's classname, such as ion-home to an HTML element.

<span class="fpg-access"></span>
